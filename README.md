# BNF Syntax Highlighter for Notepad ++
This highlighter goes well with the theme Zenburn in [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). You could modify the bgColor in the xml file, so that the bgColor for the text will be the same as the global one. For this one I use 3D3D3D. 

This is built following the documentation [here](https://ivan-radic.github.io/udl-documentation/).

>**How to import this UDL**

1. Download the xml file
2. On Notepad ++, follow Menu -> "Language" -> "Define your language..."
3. Import the UDL configuration file **BNF NPP Highlighter.xml**
4. Close and reopen your Notepad ++
5. Open your bnf file, than choose Menu -> "Language" -> "BNF"
6. You can modify the color settings by changing the styler options in Menu -> "Language" -> "Define your language...".
7. In order to use a different themem, you should also modify the font & size option, using the styler in "Define your language".


You could also change the highlight settings for braces in Menu -> "Settings" -> "Style Configurator" -> "Brace hightlight style".
